# More Awesome Music DSP*

This is a curated list of my favourite music DSP and audio programming resources. * It was originally meant to be an official "Awesome list", but apparently you are not meant to write in the first person, so it is now a "more awesome" list.

Oli Larkin

## Audio Plug-in/App Frameworks

- [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2) - Originally created by Cockos, iPlug is an awesome plug-in framework. For a long time, I was maintaining a [fork of iPlug1](https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol), but over the last few years [Alex Harker](https://github.com/AlexHarker) and I have reworked it into something new, with the imaginitive name: iPlug2. It's a massive improvement on the original version, adding support for GPU accelerated vector graphics, resizable high DPI UIs, iOS, WebViews, AUv3 and compiling to WebAudio/WASM, amongst many other things. iPlug2's syntax is super simple, for example, creating a parameter or a control in the UI is only a single line of C++ code.
- [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) - JUCE is an undeniably awesome C++ application/plug-in framework with audio roots. It boasts a vast amount of functionality for the development of music software, including support for almost all plug-in formats and platforms. JUCE is used widely in the music technology industry and it has excellent documentation, code standards, features and support. The JUCE team organise the [Audio Developer's Conference (ADC)](https://juce.com/adc) which is one of the best conferences to attend if you like audio programming. What's more all the videos from all the ADCs so far are available [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaF6fKdDrSmPDmiZcl9KLnQ/videos).
- [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/) - AudioKit uses the Swift programming language. It's a high level DSP and UI toolkit for audio things. If you want to make apps for Apple's devices this is a great option, although if you want to do more low level, custom DSP, you will still have to do some C/C++.
- [ASPiK](http://www.aspikplugins.com/) - This is a framework from [Will Pirkle](https://www.willpirkle.com/), used in his books, which is based on the VST3 SDK and it's AU/AAX wrappers, along with VST GUI and its runtime UI editor. It includes a project creator and a lot of extra "nuts and bolts" code for plug-in development.
- [DPF](https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF) - Distrho Plug-in Framework is a nice C++ plug-in framework by falkTX, supporting lots of Linux formats.
- [Jamba](https://jamba.dev/) - A new framework built on top of the VST3SDK & VSTGUI, with some useful extra widgets and good CMake support
- [DPlug](https://dplug.org/) - A plug-in framework using the D programming language, that has had a huge amount of work over many years. I haven't tried it, but I've decided to include it here in solidarity with the authors. As a fellow open-source framework developer, it's nice if people know about your work.


## Exemplary open-source plug-in instruments/effects and templates
This is a new section for plug-in projects that are great examples for plug-in dev in the year 2023, where the authors are using modern practices such as CI/CD, unit-testing and have nice build scripts, and are making their projects easy for others to compile straight away!

- [pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) - An excellent template for JUCE projects.
- [iPlug2OOS](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2OOS) - Continuing the theme of self-promotion, here is the latest and greatest iPlug2 template project, set up with CI/CD, installer scripts, github workspaces etc.
- [surge](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge) - Surge was an excellent product which has been open sourced and is now being maintained and continually improved by the surge-synth team, with a new JUCE UI.
- [valentine](https://github.com/Tote-Bag-Labs/valentine) - An awesome compressor and great, complete project example for a cross platform audio plug-in in 2023.
- [vital](https://github.com/mtytel/vital) - Vital is a very succesful wavetable synth with a slick interface done using the GPU. Amazing that a project like this can be open source!

## UI Frameworks

- [VSTGUI](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vstgui) - VSTGUI is Steinberg's cross-platform UI framework for audio plug-ins. It is released under a BSD licence, it's an impressive piece of work and many plug-in developers use it for their products.
- [Elements](https://github.com/cycfi/elements) - A very promising UI framework for audio software using modern C++.
- [PUGL](https://github.com/lv2/pugl) - A cross platform GLFW-like solution that lets plug-in developers use OpenGL for their UIs

## DSP Libraries

- [Gamma](https://github.com/LancePutnam/Gamma) - Gamma is a very awesome C++ DSP library by Lance Putnam. The beauty of Gamma is the conciseness of the implementation of certain techniques. How about [this](https://github.com/LancePutnam/Gamma/blob/master/examples/spectral/STFT.cpp) for a concise STFT example.
- [Q](https://github.com/cycfi/Q) - A very nice looking modern C++ DSP library with concise examples
- [HIIR](http://ldesoras.free.fr/prod.html) - HIIR is a seriously cool oversampling library by Laurent de Soras. Oversampling is something we often need in audio DSP, and this library handles it elegantly - providing a variety of classes for low latency IIR half band filtering (including SIMD optimizations). Originally this had a LGPL licence but now it's available under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) - my favourite licence.
- [HOALibrary](https://github.com/CICM/HoaLibrary-Light) - A flexible DSP library for high order ambisonics (HOA) - a spatial audio platform that is becoming more and more relevant thanks to VR (GPL Licence).
- [HISSTools Library](https://github.com/AlexHarker/HISSTools_Library) - a nice BSD licensed library by Alex Harker, including FFT abstractions and multi-channel  convolution, amongst other things
- [Mach1 Spatial SDK](https://github.com/Mach1Studios/m1-sdk) - Vector based multichannel & spatial audio APIs for customizing multichannel or spatial audio pipelines & tools and agnostically playback any spatial, surround soundfields.
- [Spatial Audio Framework](https://github.com/leomccormack/Spatial_Audio_Framework) - Another excellent library for ambisonics and other spatial audio related processing
- [MadronaLib](https://github.com/madronalabs/madronalib) - Randy Jones' DSP library, which is awesome because it is all designed for SIMD processing.
- [WDL](https://github.com/justinfrankel/WDL) - WDL is Cockos' library of reusable C++ code, that is used to make the DAW Reaper, amongst other things. It includes open source implementations of many useful things such as resampling and convolution, although there is next to no documentation and the code is difficult to understand. For more info about the various parts of WDL (which can be used independently), check [the Cockos site](https://www.cockos.com/wdl/)
- [DaisySP](https://electro-smith.github.io/DaisySP/) - A MIT licensed DSP library written for the Daisy platform, but also useable elsewhere. I like it because it includes some nice ports of Emilie Gillet's mutable instruments code.
- [SignalSmithDSP](https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/code/dsp/) - A really nice looking DSP library, along with a really nice [blog/website](https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/writing/) with a collection of nice articles, e.g. [How to write a reverb](https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/writing/2021/lets-write-a-reverb/), see also [a video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWnD30xHjW4)

## Music Information Retrieval Libraries (C/C++)

- [essentia](https://github.com/MTG/essentia) - Essentia is a huge collection of MIR algorithms that you can use to extract high and low level features from audio. AGPL3 license. Somewhat painful to build cross-platform.
- [audioflux](https://github.com/libAudioFlux/audioFlux) - AudioFlux is a new-kid-on the block and some what similar but looks designed for deep learning, it looks very promising and has a liberal (MIT) license.

## Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)

- [FAUST](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust) - FAUST is a powerful functional DSL for audio DSP with many options for quickly compiling to different “architectures” including audio plug-ins and embedded devices. FAUST is not interpreted like programming languages such as Puredata/Max/Supercollider/javascript, it is ["transpiled"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44931479/compiling-vs-transpiling) to C++ and various other programming languages or bytecode formats such as Web Assembly (WASM). This functionality is suited to rapid prototyping but can also produce robust and performant binaries. Whilst the rapid prototyping possibilities of FAUST are appealing to me, what I like most about it is the extensive library of high quality DSP, particularly for physical modelling synthesis and the way in which you can compose algorithms using the concise syntax. FAUST includes a JIT compiler "libfaust" based on LLVM, which I [integrated into a JUCE module](https://github.com/olilarkin/juce_faustllvm). I've also [integrated FAUST support into iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/tree/master/Examples/IPlugFaustDSP) and used it to make a [physical model of the Indian Tambura](https://github.com/olilarkin/tambura).
- [cmajor](https://github.com/SoundStacks/cmajor) - Is an exciting new DSL created by Jules Storer and Cesare Ferrari at SoundStacks, which also uses the LLVM compiler technology. It has a JIT compiler for a fast workflow and can spit out C++ and WASM and ready-to-go JUCE projects. cmajor is an imperative language much more similar to C/C++/Javascript than FAUST. It has several advantages, for example multi-rate processing and in my opinion it is more suited for code that mixes event-handling with DSP, where as FAUST is good for discreet blocks of DSP processing. Since FAUST can output cmajor code via faust2cmajor, you can use them together.

## Filter design

- [Filter Playground](https://smus.com/filter-playground) - A nice blog post and [web audio tool](https://borismus.github.io/filter-playground/) demonstrating IIR filters
- [MicroModeler Filter Design Tool](https://www.micromodeler.com) - An excellent web based filter design tool
- [DSPFilters](https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters) - Vinno Falco made this excellent MIT licensed IIR filter library. [Here](https://github.com/olilarkin/DSPFilters) is a fork to work with the latest JUCE. See also [iir1](https://github.com/berndporr/iir1), which seems a further developed and improved version.
- [RBJ Cookbook](https://webaudio.github.io/Audio-EQ-Cookbook/audio-eq-cookbook.html) - HTML version of Robert Bristow-Johnson's EQ cookbook
- [Cytomic Technical Papers](https://cytomic.com/index.php?q=technical-papers) - Andy Simper's technical papers, which include code examples and theory for modern approaches to filter design
- [Vadim Zavalishin - The Art of VA Filter Design](https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/pdf/VAFilterDesign_2.1.0.pdf) - Very math-heavy text on those modern approachs

## Reading
This is a small selection of websites, books and articles that have been helpful to me.

- [Will Pirkle](http://www.willpirkle.com/) - Will Pirkle has written two books that will be invaluable the aspiring audio plug-in developer - "Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++" and "Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++". The books contain detailed information about important audio DSP, including modern virtual analogue techniques, and sample code for complete sythesizers that sound good. My only criticism is that a large part of the books relates to a bespoke plugin framework and providing information for multiple formats, AU, VST3 can be a bit overwhelming, and clutters the content. Nevertheless I highly recommend these books. For more info [see here](http://www.willpirkle.com/about/books)

## Hardware/embedded

- [the owl pedal/module](https://hoxtonowl.com/) - This is a programmable stomp box and eurorack module that I've been working with since the kick starter campaign to launch it. It's a really nice little unit, which you can program in C++, FAUST, Pd or with Max gen~. I find the limited interface with 4 controls makes me think quite carefully about what's important about my DSP algorithm. You can find some patches I made for it (using a mixture of c++ and FAUST) in the [user library](https://www.rebeltech.org/patch-library/patches/authors), and the original code [here](https://github.com/olilarkin/OL-OWLPatches).
- [bela](https://bela.io/) - Bela is a wonderful little SoC + Audio Interface which is pretty revolutionary, allowing super low latency audio and sensor I/O all clocked together, in a tiny package. I wrote the FAUST support class for bela. You can also program it with C++ or libpd, and even supercollider.
- [ELK Audio OS](https://elk.audio/dev-kit/) - A new embedded linux OS & dev kit that runs VST2 & VST3 plugins.
- [mutable instruments](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack) - Emilie Gillet's work is inspirational. The code has been [ported to VCVRack](https://github.com/VCVRack/AudibleInstruments/tree/master/src) and to some nice [iOS AUv3s](https://github.com/boourns/Spectrum)
- [pedalvite](https://github.com/EleonoreMizo/pedalevite) - An open source pedal board project from a developer who did a lot of the DSP in the best plugins of the last ~20 years.
- [Daisy](https://www.electro-smith.com/about) - I haven't actually tried Daisy, but it looks brilliant, and I've heard good things. It has a more powerful MCU than the OWL and I really like how the same, cheap board can be plugged into different hardware. 

## Youtubers

- [TheAudioProgrammer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKb02FsH4WH4X_2xhIoJ1A) - includes a lot of tutorials about JUCE with guest slots on things like web audio.
- [TheChernoProject](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) - although this channel is focused on game development, the [C++ series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb) is excellent. Highly recommended.
